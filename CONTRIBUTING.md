# Contributing

Open-Source means we welcome all changes and ideas any time of day and nights, through issues and pull requests.

## How to contribute

As the community around this project is small enough, we set the following contributing guidelines:
 - if necessary, [open an issue](https://github.com/pandatix/nvdapi/issues/new) first
 - fork the repository
 - clone, commit, and when feeling confident enough [create a pull request](https://github.com/pandatix/nvdapi/compare) with the issue(s) it solves.
 - check your notifications for comments, suggestions, and maybe an approval
